# Analyzing the Effects of COVID on the American Real Estate Market

Team members: Ali Bridgers, Harrison Riebow, Ed Shanks

In early 2020, the covid pandemic began, causing many macroeconomic changes around the world. One of the most notable effects was a sharp rise in housing prices in real estate markets across the United States. As a group, we wanted to investigate this particular phenomenon more closely.<br>

In our study, we aim to answer three questions:
1.	How much did home prices increase after the beginning of the covid pandemic?
2.	Did any US real estate markets experience an abnormally sharp rise in home prices?
3.	Is there any correlation between the geographic location of a real estate market and the rate at which home prices accelerated in that market?<br>

We chose to use the Nasdaq Zillow API as our data source. The API offers a range of time series and metrics to track housing markets across the United States. We chose to focus on metro areas, as opposed to cities or zip codes. Metro areas encompass more residents, a wider range of socioeconomic groups, and a larger number of single-family homes. Our metric for tracking home prices is the Average Monthly Sales Price of Single-Family Homes in a Given Metro Area. For the sake of brevity, we will henceforth refer to this metric as Monthly Sales Price.
