Since the beginning of the covid pandemic, housing prices across the United States have increased significantly. This increase is observable in some form in almost all metropolitan housing markets in the United States. We want to determine if this increase is also observable in non-metropolitan housing markets. If yes: 
•	How do the price increases in non-metropolitan areas compare with those in metropolitan areas?
•	Is there a noticeable ripple effect in housing prices across metropolitan areas and surrounding non-metropolitan areas? (i.e. Is there any observable pattern in how increases in non-metropolitan housing markets coincide with increases in neighboring metropolitan housing markets ?)

We will use the Nasdaq Zillow Real Estate Data API as our primary data source. With this API we can specify a city/region by zip code and pull data from a specified time frame. Some of the useful data available in the API include Median List Price, Median Sale Price, Median List Price per Square Foot, Median Sale Price per Square Foot, and Turnover in Housing Market (in past year).
